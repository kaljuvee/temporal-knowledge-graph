# Temporal Knowledge Graph Demo

A comprehensive implementation of temporal knowledge graphs based on the [OpenAI Cookbook: Temporal Agents with Knowledge Graphs](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/partners/temporal_agents_with_knowledge_graphs/temporal_agents_with_knowledge_graphs).

## üß† Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and use temporal knowledge graphs that can:

- **Track information over time** - Know what was true at any given moment
- **Handle evolving facts** - Manage statements that change or become invalid
- **Extract temporal relationships** - Automatically identify when events occurred
- **Query across time** - Ask questions like "Who was CEO in 2023?"
- **Visualize timelines** - See how entities and relationships evolve

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system implements a complete temporal knowledge graph pipeline:

### Core Components

1. **Temporal Agent** - Processes text and extracts temporal information
2. **Knowledge Graph** - Stores statements with temporal validity
3. **Query Engine** - Handles temporal and natural language queries
4. **Invalidation System** - Manages conflicting or outdated information

### Pipeline Flow

```
Text Input
    ‚Üì
Semantic Chunking
    ‚Üì
Statement Extraction
    ‚Üì
Temporal Classification (Atemporal/Static/Dynamic)
    ‚Üì
Triplet Extraction (Subject-Predicate-Object)
    ‚Üì
Temporal Event Extraction (t_valid, t_invalid, etc.)
    ‚Üì
Entity Resolution

```

### Temporal Classifications

- **Atemporal**: Facts that never change (e.g., "Speed of light is 299,792,458 m/s")
- **Static**: Facts valid from a point in time (e.g., "Company A acquired Company B on Jan 1, 2020")
- **Dynamic**: Facts that evolve over time (e.g., "John was CEO from 2019 to 2022")

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash

streamlit run Home.py
```

2. **Open your browser** to the displayed URL (typically http://localhost:8501)

3. **Explore the interface:**
   - Add content via the "Add Content" tab
   - Query and search in the "Query & Search" tab
   - View timelines in the "Timeline View" tab
   - Analyze data in the "Analytics" tab
   - Browse all data in the "Browse Data" tab

## üìö Detailed Usage

### Core Data Models

The system uses several key data models:

#### Statement
Represents a piece of information with temporal context:
```python
statement = Statement(
    id="stmt_1",
    text="John Smith became CEO on January 1, 2024",
    temporal_class=TemporalClass.STATIC,
    fact_type=FactType.FACT,
    triplets=[...],
    temporal_event=TemporalEvent(t_valid=datetime(2024, 1, 1)),
    source="annual_report"
)
```

#### Triplet
Knowledge graph relationships in Subject-Predicate-Object format:
```python
triplet = Triplet(
    subject="John Smith",
    predicate="hasRole", 
    object="CEO"
)
```

#### TemporalEvent
Temporal validity information:
```python
temporal_event = TemporalEvent(
    t_created=datetime(2024, 1, 1),    # When statement was created
    t_valid=datetime(2024, 1, 1),      # When it becomes valid
    t_invalid=datetime(2025, 1, 1),    # When it becomes invalid
    t_expired=datetime(2025, 12, 31)   # When it expires
)
```

### Programming Interface

#### Basic Usage

```python
from utils import KnowledgeGraphManager

# Initialize
manager = KnowledgeGraphManager(api_key="your-api-key")

# Add content
statement = manager.add_statement_text(
    "Sarah Johnson became CEO of TechCorp on January 1, 2024"
)

# Query entity
result = manager.query_entity("TechCorp")

# Ask questions
result = manager.query_natural_language("Who is the current CEO?")

# Get timeline
timeline = manager.get_entity_timeline("TechCorp")
```

#### Advanced Usage

```python
from datetime import datetime
from models import TemporalQuery

# Query at specific time
result = manager.query_entity("TechCorp", timestamp=datetime(2023, 6, 1))

# Process documents
statements = manager.add_document(document_text, source="annual_report_2024")

# Save/load knowledge graph
manager.save_to_file("my_knowledge_graph.json")
manager.load_from_file("my_knowledge_graph.json")

# Get statistics
stats = manager.get_statistics()
print(f"Total statements: {stats['total_statements']}")
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (required)

### Model Configuration

The system uses `gpt-4o-mini` by default. You can modify the model in `temporal_agent.py`:

```python
self.model = "gpt-4o-mini"  # Change to your preferred model
```

## üìä Features

- **Temporal validity tracking**: Know when facts become valid/invalid
- **Statement invalidation**: Automatically handle conflicting information
- **Timeline visualization**: See how entities evolve over time

### Query Capabilities

- **Entity queries**: Find all information about specific entities
- **Natural language queries**: Ask questions in plain English
- **Temporal range queries**: Find events within time periods
- **Multi-hop reasoning**: Follow relationships across the graph

### Interface Options
