# Process multiple documents
document_folder = "documents/"
if os.path.exists(document_folder):
    for file_path in Path(document_folder).glob("*.txt"):
        with open(file_path, "r") as f:

print(f"\nDataset Statistics:")
print(f"  Total statements: {stats['total_statements']}")
print(f"  Total entities: {stats['total_entities']}")
print(f"  Temporal events: {stats['statements_with_temporal_events']}")

# Find most active entities
entities = manager.get_all_entities()
entity_activity = []
for entity in entities:
    statements = manager.kg.get_statements_for_entity(entity)
    entity_activity.append((entity, len(statements)))

# Sort by activity
entity_activity.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

## üîß Integration Examples

### API Integration

Create a REST API wrapper:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from utils import KnowledgeGraphManager

app = Flask(__name__)
manager = KnowledgeGraphManager(api_key="your-api-key")

@app.route('/add_statement', methods=['POST'])
def add_statement():
    data = request.json
    statement = manager.add_statement_text(
        data['text'], 
        source=data.get('source')
    )
    return jsonify({
        'id': statement.id,
        'temporal_class': statement.temporal_class.value,
        'triplets': [str(t) for t in statement.triplets]
    })

@app.route('/query_entity/<entity>')
def query_entity(entity):
    result = manager.query_entity(entity)
    return jsonify({
        'statements': [stmt.text for stmt in result.statements],
        'timeline': result.timeline
    })

@app.route('/ask', methods=['POST'])
def ask_question():
    question = request.json['question']
    result = manager.query_natural_language(question)
    return jsonify({
        'answer': result.answer,
        'confidence': result.confidence
    })

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Database Integration

Store knowledge graph in a database:

```python
import sqlite3
import json

def save_to_database(manager, db_path):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    # Create tables
    cursor.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS statements (
            id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
            text TEXT,
            temporal_class TEXT,
            fact_type TEXT,
            source TEXT,
            temporal_event TEXT,
            triplets TEXT
        )
    ''')
    
    # Insert statements
    for stmt in manager.kg.statements.values():
        cursor.execute('''
            INSERT OR REPLACE INTO statements 
            (id, text, temporal_class, fact_type, source, temporal_event, triplets)
            VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
        ''', (
            stmt.id,
            stmt.text,
            stmt.temporal_class.value,
            stmt.fact_type.value,
            stmt.source,
            json.dumps(stmt.temporal_event.dict() if stmt.temporal_event else None),
            json.dumps([t.dict() for t in stmt.triplets])
        ))
    
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

# Usage
save_to_database(manager, "knowledge_graph.db")
```

These examples demonstrate the versatility and power of the Temporal Knowledge Graph system across various domains and use cases. The system can be adapted to track virtually any type of temporal information and relationships.
